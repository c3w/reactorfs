### reactorFS TODO - Some of these may be SEVERE!

. pushing same path and filename will result in two(2) stores
	. suggest appending -1 rev controls or queuing system for dupes

. error (mis)handleing could result in lost data

. toolkit.php is pushing its limit - need to branch out to real logic and make toolkit a bundle of tools only, i.e. hashing should be taken out

. would be nice to have some setup scripts or web gui setup for master and nodes

. the `typer` case statement is prone to errors, possibly effecting the whole system
	. suggest a json structure with error checking

. does not handle multiple storage domains (i.e. rsync shares or other per single host)
	. file insert SQL needs modding, at least

. need multiple go-back levels in the browser
	. or at least a root
